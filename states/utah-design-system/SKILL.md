description: Builds Utah government interfaces with the official Utah Design System Sass/CSS, React components, required Utah header package, tokens, examples, and documentation. Use for Utah state products and prefer the documented CSS patterns over treating React as the only implementation.

# Utah Design System

Build within the system's documented scope and delivery model.

## Before editing

1. Confirm the product owner and that this system is authorized for the target surface.
2. Read [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md) before installing or changing dependencies.
3. Read [references/sources.md](references/sources.md) when checking versions, provenance, license, or release state.
4. Inspect the existing framework, package manager, asset pipeline, and accessibility tests. Preserve them unless the official integration requires a change.

## Workflow

1. Choose one documented delivery path; do not mix compiled, source, CDN, and framework-wrapper paths accidentally.
2. Pin the dependency or downloaded asset version and keep upstream notices.
3. Reuse official components, tokens, content guidance, and templates before adding custom UI.
4. Extend through documented tokens, properties, slots, Sass settings, or composition. Do not edit vendored package files.
5. Test semantic structure, keyboard operation, focus order and visibility, accessible names, error recovery, zoom/reflow, contrast, and target browsers.
6. Report custom patterns, unsupported requirements, and upstream gaps explicitly.

## Boundaries

- **Scope:** Utah state-government digital products. Determine whether the statewide header is required for the target surface.
- **Release:** active official repository and packages.
- **Delivery:** Sass/CSS, React components, compiled CDN assets, and a separate header package.
- Do not invent component APIs, tokens, package names, or compliance claims.
- Do not import another jurisdiction's branding to fill a gap.
- A passing component example does not prove the completed service conforms to WCAG, Section 508, the ADA, or local policy.
