# SAM Design System

## Before editing

1. Confirm the product is inside this system's scope.
2. Read [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md) before installing, copying, or changing upstream assets.
3. Read [references/sources.md](references/sources.md) for provenance, version, and license.
4. Inspect and preserve the target project's framework, package manager, asset pipeline, and accessibility tests.

## Workflow

1. Choose one documented delivery path and pin an exact package, commit, release, or downloaded asset snapshot.
2. Use only official components, tokens, templates, and examples that are actually public.
3. Extend through documented mechanisms. Label every unsupported addition as custom.
4. Record the upstream version or commit and the accepted maturity/maintenance risk.
5. Test keyboard operation, focus, names/roles/states, errors, status messages, contrast, zoom/reflow, responsive behavior, and supported browsers.

## Boundaries

- **Scope:** SAM.gov product interfaces and explicitly approved related applications.
- **Delivery:** Angular component package.
- **Release:** Active official Angular package; official documentation describes the system as an MVP in active development.
- Do not invent a registry package, public repository, component API, or release commitment.
- Do not imply that a beta, hosted asset, code example, or product-specific repository is government-wide.
- Do not claim legal or WCAG conformance for the completed service solely from component use.
- If this system does not fit the product's requirements, route to the governing system or stop and explain the gap.
